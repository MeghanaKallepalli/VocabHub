// --- How to add new words ---
// 1. Get the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., "2023-10-27").
// 2. Copy a word object, give it a new unique id, and update the word, meaning, and date.
// Example for tomorrow:
// { id: 50, word: "NewWord", meaning: "A new meaning.", date: "2023-10-28" },

// Helper to get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
const getTodaysDate = () => {
    const today = new Date();
    const year = today.getFullYear();
    const month = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); // Months are 0-indexed
    const day = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
    return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
};

const todaysDate = getTodaysDate();

export const initialWords = [
